## Summary
================================================================================

**Overview**
-----------

A set of changes has been made to the `MiniTasker` project, specifically to add a new feature related to task management. The changes involve updating the settings, URLs, migrations, models, views, and URL patterns to support this new functionality.

**Files Modified**
------------------

* `MiniTasker/settings.py`
* `MiniTasker/urls.py`
* `tasks/migrations/0001_initial.py`
* `tasks/models.py`
* `tasks/urls.py`
* `tasks/views.py`

**Key Changes**
----------------

1. Added 'tasks' to the list of installed apps in `settings.py`.
2. Updated the URLs in `MiniTasker/urls.py` to include a new URL pattern for tasks, pointing to `tasks.urls`.
3. Created a new migration (`0001_initial.py`) to define a `Task` model with title and done status.
4. Modified `tasks/models.py` to use Django's built-in models and added a `__str__` method to the `Task` model.
5. Updated `tasks/urls.py` to include URL patterns for creating and listing tasks.
6. Created new views (`create_task` and `list_tasks`) in `tasks/views.py` to handle task creation and retrieval.

**Functionality Impact**
------------------------

These changes enable the addition of a new feature related to task management, allowing users to create, list, and retrieve tasks. The `Task` model and its associated views provide a basic structure for managing tasks, but additional functionality may be required to support more advanced features.

**Potential Concerns**
----------------------

1. **Validation**: The `create_task` view does not validate the input data, which may lead to issues if invalid or malformed data is sent in the request body.
2. **Security**: The use of `csrf_exempt` in the `views.py` file may introduce security risks if not properly validated and sanitized.
3. **Database Performance**: The current implementation of task retrieval and creation may have performance implications, particularly if the number of tasks increases.

To address these concerns, it is recommended to:

1. Implement validation for user input data in `create_task`.
2. Consider using Django's built-in CSRF protection mechanisms or alternative security measures.
3. Optimize database queries and indexing as necessary to improve performance.

By addressing these potential concerns, the new task management feature can be made more robust and reliable while minimizing the risk of introducing security vulnerabilities or performance issues.
